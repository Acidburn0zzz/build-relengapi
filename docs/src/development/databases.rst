Using Databases
===============

Releng API uses `SQLAlchemy Core <http://sqlalchemy.org/>`_ to access databases.
Releng API does not use the SQLAlchemy ORM.

The system supports multiple, independent databases, each identified by a short name.
Of course, it's impossible to perform joins between independent databases.
The base defines one, ``relengapi``, that should serve as the default location for new tables.
Blueprints can define other databases, or add tables to existing databases.

The same database access object is available at ``current_app.db`` and ``g.db``; callers can use whichever is easier.

Users configure the SQLAlchemy database URIs using the ``SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URIS`` configuration parameter, which is a dictionary mapping database names to URLs.

Adding Tables
-------------

RelengAPI supports SQLAlchemy's declarative mapping syntax, with a small twist to support multiple databases:
instead of calling ``sqlalchemy.ext.declarative.declarative_base()`` to get a base class, call ``relengapi.db.declarative_base(dbname)``.

For example::

    from relengapi import db

    class User(db.declarative_base('relengapi')):
        __tablename__ = 'users'
        id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
        name = Column(String(100))
        password = Column(String(100))

Using Tables
------------

Use of the ORM layer requires a session.
The session is available from ``g.db.sessions``, keyed by database name.
For example::

    @bp.route('/add/foo')
    def add_foo():
        session = g.db.session['relengapi']

        u = User()
        u.name = 'Foo'
        u.password = 'sekrit'
        session.add(u)
        session.commit()

        return 'ok'

As you might expect, bad things will happen if you try to use tables from one database with a session for another database.

As a shortcut, each table object has a ``query`` property which is automatically bound to the table and session; this is similar to the property provided by Flask-SQLAlchemy::

    @bp.route('/get/foo')
    def get_foo():
        u = User.query.filter_by(name='Foo').get()
        return jsonify(userid=u.id)

Engines, MetaData, etc.
-----------------------

Although most uses of the database should occur by the ORM methods described above, some operations require more data.

The engine for a database is available from the ``current_app.db.engine`` method::

    eng = current_app.db.engine('relengapi')

The list of database names is at ``current_app.db.database_names``.

The known metadata for each database is in ``current_app.db.metadata``, keyed by database name.
