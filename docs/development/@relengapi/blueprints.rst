Writing a Blueprint
===================

All non-core functionality in RelengAPI is implemented in separate projects that "plug in" to the core.
These separate projects are referred to as "blueprints" since they are implemented as Flask blueprints.

This arrangement allows developers to focus on the task at hand by installing only the relevant blueprint and the core.
It also nicely isolates purpose-specific code in its own repository, allowing it to evolve independewntly of the core and other blueprints, as suggested by the [Releng Best Practices](https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReleaseEngineering/Development_Best_Practices).

Getting Started
---------------

Pick a name for your blueprint.
This guide will use "bubbler", so it's easy to spot.

Begin by setting up a virtualenv or other dedicated Python environment, in whatever way you're comfortable with.
Then clone https://github.com/mozilla/build-relengapi-skeleton.git:

    git clone --origin skeleton https://github.com/mozilla/build-relengapi-skeleton.git build-bubbler

and enter that directory.  Now it's time to rename everything.  First, rename the files:

    find * -name '*skeleton*' | while read s; do d=$(echo $s | sed s/skeleton/bubbler/g); git mv $s $d; done

Now edit the files referring to skeletons:

    git grep skeleton | while read s; do sed s/skeleton/bubbler/ < $s > $s~; mv $s~ $s; done

Have a look at ``setup.py`` to fix the author name, and so on.
Once that's ready, try installing your blueprint:

    pip install -e .[test]

With a little luck, this will install relengapi and its dependencies successfully.
Time to run it!

    relengapi serve -a -p 8010

Then visit http://localhost:8010/bubbler/ (subsituting the appropriate host and port if necessary).
You should see a short JSON greeting.

You can run the unit tests with

    relengapi run-tests

And you can perform the same validation that Travis will with

    bash validate.sh

Get hacking!

Updating
--------

From time to time, pull updates from the upstream skeleton project.
This will get your project the latest support scripts and other paraphernalia.
Any conflicts may identify fixes required for continued compatibility with the core, although the lack of conflicts does not guarantee compatibility!

    git pull skeleton master
